# Open Source Governance Models

This repo collects data about the governance models of open source projects. The goal is to provide an overview about how open source projects shape their governance, collect links to the relevant policy documents and other relevant information, and store that in a machine-readable form so it can easily be processed for further analysis.

Data is collected in JSON files in the `data` directory, one file per project. There is a list of standard attributes outlined in `data/_template.json`. This is a beginning, the structure will change while we learn what is most interesting and relevant. Contributions are welcome.

There is a simple web site generated from the data available in the `docs` directory and served at https://cornelius.github.io/open-source-governance.

If you have questions or comments please don't hesitate to open an issue or contact Cornelius Schumacher <schumacher@kde.org>.
