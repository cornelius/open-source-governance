# This is a template for storing data of the governance model of an open source project.
# Fill out the fields and contribute it to https://github.com/cornelius/open-source-governance
# to get it listed in the governance model map which is hosted there.
#
# The type of the fields is not strictly defined. Try to be as exact as you can, but feel free
# to resort to text if you don't have exact data. Add comments to provide additional context
# such as the source of the data.
#
# Sometimes there is no clear value for an attribute. Use the following convention to indicate
# why a value is missing:
#
#   "?"              - not checked yet
#   none           - the project specifically does not have this
#   not applicable - this attribute is not applicable to this project
#
# Note that we make a difference between project and organization here. The project is the
# group and effort writing the code. The organization is the formal entity providing governance,
# legal, and financial support. This could be a non-profit organization or a company. Some
# projects don't even have a formal organization behind.
#
# The data of the organizations is entered in the `orgs` sub directory. There is an extra
# template file there.
#
# Refer to the comments in the template for an explanation of the fields.

# Version of the YAML schema used for this file. v1 is going to change without notice. Later versions will be kept stable.
